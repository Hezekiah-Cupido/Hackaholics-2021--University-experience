# Hackathon May 2021
- Statement
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote learning has become part and 
parcel of the university experience. This has led to new students missing out on 
the typical university experience. Gone are the days of sitting on the Jammie 
steps and chatting with your friends, messaging someone you met once for help 
with homework and creating long-lasting friendships with people you met during 
o-week. Your job is to facilitate the "university experience 2.0". Create a way for 
students to take back their right to have an all-encompassing university 
experience.

# Our Solution:
We all want to enjoy the best years of our lives at University but unfortunately Coronavirus has gotten in the way. Circumstances have made it difficult to meet people and find out just exactly what experiences one ought to have whilst at University. We have made a platform that enables students from the same university to post experiences they have had and recommend every else has whilst they are at university. Students are then given a dashboard of tiles of the top experiences of their fellow students.

For instance a student at the University of Cape Town could feel that climbing Lionâ€™s Head, partying on Long-Street, watching a recital at the Music School or going to the V&A Waterfront are all experiences a UCT student might enjoy.

On our platform each of these experiences will appear as a card. If a student partakes in one of the experiences, they can tick-it-off their University Bucket List and earn points. The more points you have, the more of University you have experienced.

You also have the ability to see who else has partaken in a particular experience

If a student has a unique experience themselves, they can recommend it to the wider university community sing the platform. If it is popular, it will appear on more often on other students dashboards.
